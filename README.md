This is a fork of gesuit: https://github.com/Cube-Space/geSuit

Permission to use/abuse code obtained via IRC on Spigot's network in #spigot-chat on 1.2.2016.

<CyberTiger> Whilst you're here geNAZt, can I ask permission to fork gesuit, I know you don't maintain it anymore, but I wasn't planning on including any modifications since you managed to get someone else to maintain it P
<CyberTiger> not that I have time atm to do much with it, but might as well ask now.
<geNAZt> Yeah sure you can have it
<geNAZt> Also want CloudChat? :D
<CyberTiger> No :P
<CyberTiger> Got my own chat thing already.

The code is horribly broken, but is in a better state to be fixed now everything is in one repository.
